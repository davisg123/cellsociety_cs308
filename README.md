========================

###Names:

wkc10 , dcg13 , wm56

###Date/time:
Date Started: 09/14/14
Date Completed: 09/26/14
Hours Spent: Around 40 per person

###Roles
Will Chang - life, predator and ant simulation (incomplete), grid behavior and rules, simulation chart
Davis Gossage - user interface, main controller, segregation simulation
Wenjun Mao - xml parsing, colorpicking, forest simulation, sugarscape simulation

###Resources used:
CS308 class website and links for simulation instructions.  Stack overflow for syntax questions.    Java/Javafx official documentation.

###Files used:
Used hello world javafx code for initializing the scene

###Files needed:
Xml files needed for running the simulation are found in the InputFiles directory

###Known bugs:

###Assignment impressions:
Would have been nice to have had a general since of what would need to be implemented later so that we could have made those design decisions up front.  For example: it was difficult to accomodate patches of different shapes once the gridpane functionality was already in place.
